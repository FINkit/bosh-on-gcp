# BOSH on GCP with bosh-bootloader

## Create a BOSH Director using bosh-bootloader (_bbl_)
Create a BOSH Director within GCP using the `build-bosh-resources.sh` script:
```
$ ./build-bosh-resources.sh <GCP_PROJECT>
```

This will create a VM within GCP for the BOSH Director, the VM will have an external IP address and have connectivity
to the Internet. This is built using the default Terraform recipe generated by *bosh-bootloader*, and is not deemed fit
for production use at present (*unless secured in some fashion*).
